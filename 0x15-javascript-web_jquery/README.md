# 0x15 Javascript - Web JQuery :roller_coaster:

> JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. This project covers Jquery and DOM events

At the end of this project, I was able to solve these questions:

* How to select HTML elements in Javascript
* How to select HTML elements with jQuery
* What are differences between ID, class and tag name selectors
* How to modify an HTML element style
* How to get and update an HTML element content
* How to modify the DOM
* How to make a GET request with jQuery Ajax
* How to make a POST request with jQuery Ajax
* How to listen/bind to DOM events
* How to listen/bind to user events


```
